    "This scatter plot visually illustrates the relationship between the floor area of a building and its corresponding square footage. Additionally, it provides insight into the construction years of these buildings, shedding light on whether older structures tend to exhibit more floors and square footage in comparison to newer ones. The choice of a scatter plot was deliberate, as it offers an effective means of identifying outliers and discerning patterns among these three key variables. The 'inferno' color scheme was selected for its consistency in color, making it easier to distinguish outliers due to its darker shades at the lower end of the spectrum."

The chart's height is set at 200 to ensure full visibility of all Congress members' names.\n",

The interactive nature of this chart enhances its appeal and clarity, particularly considering the substantial volume of data it conveys. In essence, it consolidates what would typically require multiple plots into a single, comprehensive visualization."
